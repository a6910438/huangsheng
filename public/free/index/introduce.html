                   <p>When I was young and free and my imagination
had no limits,
</p>
                   <p>I dreamed of changing the world.
As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world
would not change,
</p>
                    <p> so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided</p><p> to change only my country.</p><p> But it, too, seemed immovable.
As I grew into my twilight years, in one last
desperate attempt,
</p><p>I settled for changing only my family, those
closest to me,
                  .</p><p>but alas, they would have none of it.
And now, as I lie on my deathbed, I suddenly
realize:
If I had only changed myself first,
</p><p>then by example I would have changed my
family.
From their inspiration and encouragement,
                  </p><p>I would then have been able to better my country,</p><p>and who knows, I may have even changed the
world.
